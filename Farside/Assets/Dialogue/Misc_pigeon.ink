<size=50>Oh! Someone's here!</size>
Well, you weren't supposed to catch me in the act...
* [What act?]
Huh? You don't know what I'm doing?
I've been secretly planting sunflowers in the farm, even though I'm only supposed to plant wheat. 
I've been able to get away with it so far because this plot's managed by me, and no one comes to check.
I know we farmers aren't supposed to do this, but I simply love sunflower seeds. So I just had to!
Please don't tell anyone that I'm doing this! Okay?!
