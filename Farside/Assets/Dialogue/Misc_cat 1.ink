Hiya, farmer. Just kidding, I know you aren't one.
How would you do farming with only two legs? I can't even <i>think</i> of it happening.
Oh, have you checked out both our farms? There's one here, and another one to the west. 
You should go look around. I think you'll like it!
You'll have to go the long way around, though. The two farms are blocked off from one another.
