it's supposed to be top-secret in the village, but...
did you know that murders have occurred in this very forest?
the victims were all humans, or so the rumour goes.
why am i spilling the beans about the village's secrets? 
well, why not! i don't belong to this village anymore.
none of us bats have a place here, after we were chased out by that EVIL bird everyone <i>idolises</i>.
we will always be the villains of the story...just because you got recruited by that UGLY bird first.
it's sad how you got roped into killing my brethren who're here to take revenge on the village. 
well, whateva! have fun playing lapdog for the EVIL bird. 
maybe one day you'll cause the village to come crashing down, <i>as it truly should!</i>
