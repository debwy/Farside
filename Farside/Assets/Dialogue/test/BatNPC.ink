Oh get a load of this, it's a human!
Wow geez, are you lost?

-> choices

 
=== choices ===
 * [Yeah...]
    Oh of course you are
    This place is out in the middle of nowhere!!!
    -> choices2
    
 * [Nope, not at all]
     Does that mean.... you came to see me?
     -> choices3

=== choices2 ===
* [Did you get here after listening to that really cryptic bird as well?]
    Oh that pigeon
    Sad to say but you've come the wrong way
    I know the answer but spilling the beans like this isn't any fun, y'know
    Good luck out there!
    -> DONE
* [Where am I?]
    My little camp I set up for myself, that's where
    There's quite literally nothing here but me
    And... and my chair
    That I don't use...
    Why did I even have a chair again?
 -> DONE
 
=== choices3 ===
    * [Yup]
    Aw that makes me happy
    Unfortunately though I've been exiled from the town ages ago
    So even though you have the face of someone reeeeally wanting a recommendation
    Sad to say I can't give you one ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    -> choices4
    
    * [Nah]
    :(((((
    -> DONE
    
=== choices4 ===
    * [Wait... why?]
        Well, sad to say but other bats probably aren't as friendly as I am
        Y'see, their actions got as all chased out of the village (sigh)
        Well if you don't know what I'm talking about that's great
        Though you probably encountered a number of them on the way here...
        -> choices4
    * [That's too bad then]
        Yeah, a real shame really...
        Well if you ever feel like paying me another visit you know where to find me!
        -> DONE
